# About Program:
The main goal was to write a program that would be able to use the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt a given word using custom key.
The key is used to define the shift. Each letter in the key represents a different shift based on the letter's place in alphabet

This is the first program in my portfolio. It wasn't supposed to be here and that's why it's in Polish. Yet I was so proud of this program that I've decided to add it here.
