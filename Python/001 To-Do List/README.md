# About program:
The main goal was to start learning by doing. I picked up an idea and then got to work.
This project is CLI-based. I learned how to use theoretical knowledge and how to use Python docs.
I acquired knowledge about JSON structure and how to open and edit it in Python. 
This program was the result of the course Introduction to Python.
I would like to add some features here in future, but I think that I would learn more if I pick up a new project since I'm pretty satisfied with this now.
