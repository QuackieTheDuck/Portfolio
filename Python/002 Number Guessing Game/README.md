# This project is still under development.

## About:
I wanted to create a simple, platform-independent GUI for a classical game, so I picked tkinter.
The idea is that you guess numbers and a table on the left changes colors to help you to guess more accurately.
I will add a scoreboard saved in CSV(in order to learn another file format).
I learned about classes in Python and about geometry managers and widgets in tkinter.
