# Lines of code counter, with tracking progress over time
## Still under developement.
This is first project made in Practical Ptython course. Primary the goal was to count lines of code and print them on CLI.
I want to add by myself saving it into a CSV file(I consider other file formats), then making a basic web page which will show graphs of progress for all lannguages from this CSV file.
