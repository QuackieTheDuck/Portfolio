# Portfolio
There I'll gather all my programing projects.
Starting with basic projects working inside terminal to more advanced ones(in future).
This repository is created because I want to track my progress.
I believe that it will be really usefull while looking for a job in future.
---
I'm aware that I still have a lot to learn but I want to show that I work on my skills and try to be better.
I know that I don't know any style guides or design patterns but I believe I won't get better without doing.
In conclusion: I'm really sorry if looking at my code hurts your eyes but please keep in mind that I'm still learning.
