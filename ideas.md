1. Command Line Tool
   - Create a CLI utility with command-line arguments, flags, and options using clap or structopt
2. Web Server
   - Build a simple HTTP server using the hyper or actix-web crate to handle GET/POST requests
3. File Encryptor/Decryptor
   - Implement a program that encrypts and decrypts files using symmetric encryption (e.g., AES)
4. Concurrent Web Scraper
   - Use threads or async/await to scrape multiple websites concurrently and store results
5. Game of Life
   - Implement Conway's Game of Life with a grid, rules for cell evolution, and a simple UI (CLI or GUI)
